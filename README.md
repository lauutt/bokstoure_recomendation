# Book Recommendation System for Brick-and-Mortar & Online Bookstore

This repository contains the development of a book recommendation system designed for a bookstore transitioning into the online realm while maintaining its physical presence. The project tackles a two-phase problem.

## Objective
The primary goal is to create a recommendation system that suggests books based on literary genres. In the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) phase, the system will provide recommendations sorted by a popularity ranking. Additionally, a collaborative filtering model will be implemented to suggest books based on user preferences. A prototype will also be built to predict the rating a user might give to a book they haven't read yet. This feature aims to add an element of playful interaction to the user's experience with the online store, akin to a 'fortune-telling ball'.


## Features
- **Genre-based Recommendations**: Initial phase focuses on suggesting books based on literary genres.
- **Popularity Ranking**: Recommendations are sorted by popularity within genres.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Offers personalized recommendations based on user preferences.
- **Rating Prediction**: Predicts potential user ratings for unread books.
- **Interactive Experience**: Introduces an engaging feature for users exploring the online bookstore.
